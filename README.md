This application makes an inventory database and uses the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend together with the npm mysql package. 

In order to run this application, you should have the MySQL database already set up on your machine. If you don't, visit https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL isntalled, you will be able to create the Bamazon database with Bamazon.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL client like MySQL Workbench.

The interface will show the list of products, their ID's, cost, category and stock. 

To run the customer interface please follow the steps below:

    git https://github.com/Guidarius/Bamazon.git
	git clone 
	cd bamazon
	npm install
	node bamazonCustomer.js
